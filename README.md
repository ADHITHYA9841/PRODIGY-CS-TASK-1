Functions:

caesar_cipher_encrypt(text, shift):

Purpose: Encrypts a given text using the Caesar cipher with a specified shift value.
Parameters:
text: The plain text message to be encrypted (string).
shift: The number of positions to shift letters by (integer).
Logic:
Inner function transform(text, shift):
Initializes an empty string transformed_text to store the encrypted message.
Iterates through each character char in the text:
Checks if char is an alphabetical character (letter) using char.isalpha().
If yes:
Determines the base code (shift_base) based on the character's case:
Uppercase: shift_base = 65 (ASCII code for 'A').
Lowercase: shift_base = 97 (ASCII code for 'a').
Applies the Caesar cipher formula:
new_char_code = (ord(char) - shift_base + shift) % 26 + shift_base
ord(char): Gets the ASCII code of the current character.
- shift_base: Adjusts for the base code (uppercase or lowercase).
+ shift: Applies the shift value.
% 26: Wraps around the alphabet (e.g., 'X' + 3 becomes 'A').
Converts the new character code back to a character using chr().
Appends the encrypted character to transformed_text.
If not an alphabetical character:
Simply adds the original character char to transformed_text (leaves punctuation, spaces, etc. unchanged).
Returns the transformed_text (encrypted message).
Outer function:
Calls the inner transform function with the provided text and shift arguments.
Returns the encrypted message from the inner function.
caesar_cipher_decrypt(text, shift):

Purpose: Decrypts a Caesar cipher encrypted text using the same shift value.
Parameters:
text: The encrypted text to be decrypted (string).
shift: The shift value used for encryption (integer).
Logic:
This function is a shortcut for decryption. It simply calls the caesar_cipher_encrypt function with a negative shift value. Decrypting a Caesar cipher is the same as encrypting with the opposite shift.
main():

Purpose: The main entry point of the program, providing an interactive interface for encryption and decryption.
Logic:
Displays a banner with program information.
Enters a loop that continues until the user quits.
Inside the loop:
Prompts the user to choose between "encrypt," "decrypt," or "quit."
Validates the user's choice.
Prompts the user to enter the message and shift value.
Handles potential ValueError if the user enters a non-integer shift value.
Based on the choice:
Encrypts the message using caesar_cipher_encrypt and prints the encrypted message.
Decrypts the message using caesar_cipher_decrypt and prints the decrypted message.
Overall, this code provides a well-structured implementation of the Caesar cipher with a user-friendly interface. It includes error handling for invalid user input and separates the encryption logic into a reusable function.

Here are some potential improvements to consider:

Handling mixed-case alphabets: The current code treats uppercase and lowercase letters separately. You could modify the logic to handle a mixed-case alphabet for a more robust encryption scheme.
Security considerations: The Caesar cipher is a very weak encryption method and can be easily broken. You could add a disclaimer or mention its limitations for educational purposes.
Additional features: You could enhance the program by allowing users to choose between different ciphers (e.g., ROT13 - a Caesar cipher with a shift of 13) or encrypting/decrypting files instead of just text strings.
